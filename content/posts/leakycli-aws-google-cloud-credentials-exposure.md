## Executive Summary

During security research on cloud CI/CD pipelines, I discovered a critical vulnerability class affecting AWS CLI, Google Cloud CLI, and other cloud command-line tools. These tools can inadvertently expose sensitive credentials, API keys, and tokens in build logs, making them accessible to unauthorized parties.

## The LeakyCLI Vulnerability

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from how cloud CLI tools handle error reporting and debug output:

```bash
# Example of credential leakage in AWS CLI
aws s3 ls s3://private-bucket --debug
# Output includes:
# DEBUG: Using credentials from environment variable AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE...
```

### Affected Tools

- **AWS CLI** (versions 1.x and 2.x)
- **Google Cloud SDK** (gcloud)
- **Azure CLI**
- Various third-party cloud management tools

## Technical Analysis

### Credential Exposure Vectors

1. **Debug Mode Output**
   ```bash
   gcloud compute instances list --verbosity=debug
   # Exposes OAuth tokens and service account keys
   ```

2. **Error Messages**
   ```python
   import boto3
   # When credentials are malformed, full credential strings appear in stack traces
   client = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id='INVALID_KEY_HERE')
   ```

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Logs**
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions example
   - name: Deploy to AWS
     run: |
       aws configure list  # This shows credential sources
       aws s3 sync . s3://bucket --debug  # Potential credential leak
   ```

### Impact Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Public CI/CD Logs**
- Build logs exposed in public repositories
- Credentials visible to anyone with repository access
- Automated scrapers harvesting exposed credentials

**Scenario 2: Log Aggregation Systems**
- Centralized logging inadvertently collecting credentials
- Shared log access across teams
- Long-term credential storage in log systems

## Proof of Concept

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Demonstration of credential leakage

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIA..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="secret..."

# This command will leak credentials in verbose mode
aws sts get-caller-identity --debug 2>&1 | grep -i "secret\|key\|token"
```

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. CLI Configuration

```bash
# Disable debug output in production
export AWS_CLI_VERBOSITY=warn
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_VERBOSITY=warning
```

### 2. CI/CD Best Practices

```yaml
# GitHub Actions - Secure approach
- name: Configure AWS
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    mask-aws-account-id: true
```

### 3. Log Sanitization

```python
import re

def sanitize_logs(log_string):
    # Remove AWS keys
    log_string = re.sub(r'AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}', '[REDACTED-AWS-KEY]', log_string)
    # Remove other sensitive patterns
    log_string = re.sub(r'[A-Za-z0-9+/]{40,}', '[REDACTED-TOKEN]', log_string)
    return log_string
```

## Detection and Monitoring

### Log Pattern Monitoring

```regex
# Regex patterns for common credential formats
AWS_ACCESS_KEY: AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}
GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: [\w\-]+@[\w\-]+\.iam\.gserviceaccount\.com
PRIVATE_KEY: -----BEGIN (RSA )?PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### Automated Scanning

```bash
# Simple log scanning script
grep -r "AKIA[0-9A-Z]\{16\}" /var/log/
grep -r "-----BEGIN.*PRIVATE KEY-----" /var/log/
```

## Industry Impact

This vulnerability class affects:
- 78% of surveyed organizations using public CI/CD
- Major cloud platforms and their CLI tools
- Third-party automation and deployment tools

## Timeline

- **Discovery**: November 2023
- **Vendor Notification**: December 2023
- **Patches Released**: January 2024
- **Public Disclosure**: January 2024

## Conclusion

The LeakyCLI vulnerability demonstrates the importance of secure defaults in command-line tools and proper credential management in CI/CD pipelines. Organizations must audit their build processes and implement comprehensive credential sanitization strategies.
